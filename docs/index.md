## What is Dynamic Typing?

For the 2025 Annual Python Discord Codejam, the Monumental Monsteras put together the incredibly fun and totally not at all frustrating words per minute testing site, "Dynamic Typing". Dynamic Typing was built to fit the theme "wrong tool for the job", where the user is able to test their words per minute score, but they were *not* able to use their keyboard. Instead, the user has to choose how they would like to complete their typing test from the available options, all of which are very much the *wrong* tool for the job.

## Framework
We chose the NiceGUI framework to build our frontend, including the user interface and the input methods, which were majorly ran on built in-modules of NiceGUI. We chose NiceGUI because of its easy-to-use modules that allow manipulation of almost any HTML element with CSS, as well as its seamless implementation of Tailwind CSS and the Quasar properties.

## Installation
